I've always had an interest in computers and programming; ever since a young age I've had the opportunity to learn how to use technology and computers. This love of technology has led me to learning to program in multiple languages including *Python*, *C++*, *C#*, *C*, *Bash*, *GDScript*, and *Go*. My experience in each language varies, with *C++*, *Python*, and *GDScript* being the ones I have the most experience with. I have experience in *Python* from writing a shell called |https://github.com/d1j1t0/omnishell/|OmniShell|. This was my first project, and my *Python* has *improved* since then. However, if you wish to learn more about the project then please take a look at the |https://d1j1t0.github.io#Projects|Projects tab|. For the other languages, such as *GDScript*, *C#*, and *C++*, I have experience in all of these from writing games in *various engines*. My *C++* experience, however, is actually not just from writing a game, but instead from writing both the game and the engine using the *Raylib library*. The *C++* project will be *released soon*, but until then I can't reveal any more details.
