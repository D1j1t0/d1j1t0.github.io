WEBSITE WIP, MORE COMING SOON.

# A brief introduction

Hello there, my name is D1j1t, and welcome to my website. I hope you enjoy your stay and find something that interests you as much as my projects interest me.

Now, you may have some questions about this place and who I am. I hope to answer any questions you may have here:

- Q: *Who* are you?
- A: As stated earlier, my name is D1j1t. I am a *programmer*, an *artist*, a *designer*, and generally just a overall creative person.

- Q: *What* is this place?
- A: This is my website, and it serves as a portal into a glimpse of my world. I aim to try and keep this place up-to-date with any interesting |https://d1j1t0.github.io#Projects|personal projects| I undertake and any new |https://d1j1t0.github.io#Skills|skills| I am *learning*. This place also serves as a way to provide |https://d1j1t0.github.io#Contact|my contact information| with people.

- Q: *Why* are you called D1j1t, what's your real name?
- A: *D1j1t is an alias* I use to help *separate my personal life and public/internet life*, and although it is not my legal name I still consider it to be just as personal. I also use an alias as I *prefer to remain anonymous* as I feel that nowadays it has become far too normalized for people to expose their whole life to the internet, and I simply don't want any and every random person to know every little detail about me.

If you still have a question that has gone unanswered I hope you will feel free to ask it by contacting me via |mailto:thereald1j1t@gmail.com?subject=I%20have%20a%20question.|email|. Feel free to ask or suggest anything, I'll try to respond to anything sent if I can.

Anyway, with introductions out of the way, please feel free to keep reading or to explore some of the other tabs below.

# My interests and hobbies

So let me begin by stating, you most likely arrived here via one of these:
[assets/intro/card.png]

This is *my business card*. It is *3D printed* and was modeled in *Blender* using an SVG of a QR code. The main issues with this project were finding a 3D printable solution to the QR Code's finder patterns, and figuring the tolerences on my printer. I ended up landing on this design and with the correct slicer settings I can produce them using only 2g of filament.

I wanted a *business card* that *stood out* and wouldn't break so easily so I felt that *3D printing* them would make them more *memorable* and durable. People have also told me how aero dynamic they are, this was not an intentional part of the design but if people find joy in this fact then who am I to judge.

*3D Printing* is one of my hobbies, and *Blender* is a software that I have been using for years to create *artwork*. After getting a *3D printer* I started using *Blender* to also create *other designs* for things like *book stands*, *Raspberry Pi cases* and also *cable management solutions*. If you would like to see *more projects* like this one then please feel free to check out the |https://d1j1t0.github.io#Projects|Projects tab|, as for the *art* I made *Blender* they can found at the |https://d1j1t0.github.io#Art|Art tab| below.
