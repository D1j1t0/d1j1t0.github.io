# $(ó°¯‰)$ Solo Mission

This was my first game. It is a basic bullet hell with dynamic level loading and mod support. There is more info on the game's |https://d1j1t.itch.io/solo-mission|itch.io page|. This was a game that I made in the *Godot* game engine. I started the project with a basic understanding of Godot and the GDScript language, and after this project I feel a lot more *confident* in my *Godot* and *GDScript* abilities. I now feel that I am *very proficient* at *Godot* and *GDScript*. I wanted to make a bullet hell game since I really enjoy bullet hell games such as Touhou and Undertale/Deltarune. After playing these games I became curious as to *how one would go about creating a game in this genre*, so I decided that best way to find out would be to give it a go. I didn't want to do anything too ambitious with *my first game*; I mainly just wanted a basic game with it being moddable, since that is something that is important to me. I also treated this game as an opportunity to learn how to make some *pixel art*. I had made some pixel art pieces/sprites before this project but they were quite frankly not good, however we all have to start somewhere. Throughout this project my pixel art *improved massively* and now I can say that I actually quite like my pixel art. I still want to get even better but *I'm really proud* of how much *I improved* over the span of the project.
