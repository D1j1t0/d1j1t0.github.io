# $(󰯉)$ Solo Mission

This was my first game. It is a basic bullet hell with dynamic level loading and mod support. There is more info on the game's |https://d1j1t.itch.io/solo-mission|itch.io page|. This was a game that I made in the *Godot* game engine. I started the project with a basic understanding of Godot and the GDScript language, and after this project I feel a lot more *confident* in my *Godot* and *GDScript* abilities. I now feel that I am *very proficient* at *Godot* and *GDScript*. I wanted to make a bullet hell game since I really enjoy bullet hell games such as Touhou and Undertale/Deltarune. After playing these games I became curious as to *how one would go about creating a game in this genre*, so I decided that best way to find out would be to give it a go. I didn't want to do anything too ambitious with *my first game*; I mainly just wanted a basic game with it being moddable, since that is something that is important to me. I also treated this game as an opportunity to learn how to make some *pixel art*. I had made some pixel art pieces/sprites before this project but they were quite frankly not good, however we all have to start somewhere. Throughout this project my pixel art *improved massively* and now I can say that I actually quite like my pixel art. I still want to get even better but *I'm really proud* of how much *I improved* over the span of the project.

# $(󰉊)$ Paperscaper
[assets/projects/paperscaper.png]
This was my first collaborative project. It is a simple cosy game with a unique look. It is a fairly simple concept since I mainly wanted to challenge myself by making it in a custom game engine I wrote using the Raylib library. Most of the development time in my half of the project was taken up by writing the back-end mechanics of the game such as: rotational logic as-well as saving and loading. My other collaborator on the project did all of the art although the menus/icons were designed and implemented by me. I wanted to undertake the task of writing a custom engine because I wanted to learn C++ and thought that diving into the deep end and forcing myself to have an outcome by the project deadline would make me learn faster and feel motivated, this worked quite well and I now feel like I have a decent understanding of a lot of the main parts of C++ as well as a much deeper understanding of object oriented programming in general. The other thing I learned through working on this project was teamwork and what it is like working with another person in different areas of a project. I found working with others and offloading the art on someone else to be very rewarding, having someone else to bounce ideas off of really brought a lot to this project (also the art just ended up looking beautiful). I feel really proud of how much I learned through this project and I also look forward to working with others in the future! The game (although basic) is available to |https://d1j1t.itch.io/paperscaper|download on itch.io|!
